  "world": "Every website is a world. A website begins and comes to be, just as worlds do. Every website is a specific contextual environment and vessel shaped by its creator and then dwelled in. Every website is a world. Every website is a totality, a body that constitutes its own entities and stories, evoking a bordered place. A website is in constant relation to other websites around it. A website is held together by human activity and belief, positing a future and an environment within its premises. A website is a world. We are creators.",
  
  "material": "Any world can be reduced into some component breakdown, as a website can be reduced to a bundle of HTML, CSS, JS, and other accompanying assets. Any thing that can be reduced to a material must have an essence beyond these components â€” process, structure, and frameworks matter, but how these materials come to be in the world and our understanding of them alter our relationships with websites. A website as a bundle of files is often a forgotten factor."
